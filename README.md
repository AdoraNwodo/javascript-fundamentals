Code snippets for different Javascript concepts.

This can be used as a Javascript starter kit for anyone who would love to get their hands dirty and start coding Javascript for the Web, Mobile or Desktop Applications.

Advanced concepts would be covered as well, but would start from the very beginning ❤️❤️❤️

P.S: Any help in adding code snippets would be highly appreciated.
